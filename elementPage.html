                In Search of Lost Time also translated as Remembrance of Things Past, is a novel in seven volumes 
                by Marcel Proust (1871â€“1922). It is his most prominent work, known both for its length and its theme 
                of involuntary memory; the most famous example of this is the "episode of the madeleine," which occurs 
                early in the first volume. It gained fame in English in translations by C. K. Scott Moncrieff and Terence 
                Kilmartin as Remembrance of Things Past, but the title In Search of Lost Time, a literal rendering of the French,
                became ascendant after D. J. Enright adopted it for his revised translation published in 1992.
